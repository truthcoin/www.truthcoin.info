### Looking for something?

Hello! A project and a blog once lived here. Now, by popular demand, my project has [changed its name to Hivemind and found a new home](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/). (All old hyperlinks will continue to work.)

Still, this blog remains!

### It's a great blog.

Consistently winning praise, retweets, and upvotes from Bitcoin Experts around the web, this blog is famous for getting the "last word" on topics such as:

* [When blockchains are useful, from First Principles.](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/limits-of-blockchain/)
* Why Proof of Stake [isn't cheaper](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest), and [isn't better](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-and-mining) than Proof of Work.
* [Why Smart Contracts are Bad for Bitcoin, but Oracles are Good](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains), and [How to Fix Smart Contracts](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/wise-contracts/).
* [Bitcoin and Deflation - Why the focus on macro is a waste of time.](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/deflation-the-last-word)
* [The "BitUSD", namely "why it was always going to be a dissapointment".](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/bitusd)
* Decentralization - [how to measure it](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization) and how to [increase it](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/active-decentralization).
* ...and much more!

### What's the Point?

The synthesis of everything that I've written so far is that <b>Bitcoin is a *specific* solution to a *specific* problem</b>. Attempts to generalize Bitcoin's "blockchain" to new areas will, in general, end in failure.

Ironically, I've done exactly such a generalization with [my own Bitcoin 2.0 project](http://bitcoinhivemind.com/)! And, believe it or not, I even have two other Bitcoin 2.0 projects planned!

So I suppose the real message is "you'd better run it by me first", or "read this blog to learn about the things you should avoid".

On that note: *every single entity* on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/), with the exception of Bitcoin, and, arguably, the Bitcoin-metacoins, is inherently flawed. By this, I mean, each has a *negative* economic value and **should be abandoned**. Even the metacoins won't last, they are inferior to imminently-arriving alternatives.

### Disclaimer

As of March 2016 I am full-time [employed at Bloq](http://bloq.com/). Those seeking advice, reports, consulting, software, etc, of the enterprise-quality, should contact <a href="mailto:sales@bloq.com" target="_top">sales@bloq.com</a>.

The opinions expressed here are my own and not at all necessarily shared by Bloq Inc. In general, I cannot understate the [complexity of modern blockchain technology](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf). Many of the smartest, most experienced, and most-hardworking people I have ever met, have worked in this area and made mistakes and embarassed themselves (myself included, of course). Anyone with a shred of wisdom will think twice, preferably several times, before relying on any of the blockchain-information presented here. I happen to believe that this is the best blockchain-econ writing on the internet (I wouldn't write it if I didn't think people needed to read it), but just because it is "the best", doesn't necessarily mean that it is "any good".
