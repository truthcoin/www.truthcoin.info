title: Paul Sztorc Media Appearances
---



A lot of people enjoy hearing what I have to say, but personally I am not sure that I am cut out to be a podcast host:

* Attracting and keeping an audience is hard work, and takes a lot of time.
* I don't like the idea of doing a "regular" show -- ie, a show every week (or so). I'd rather only do a show if I have something important to say. Something worthy of people's scarce time and attention.
* As a podcast audience grows, the percentage of unremarkable people (and [crazy people](https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/)) also grows. Then you end up pandering, instead of speaking your mind. Also, it leads to awkward conversations about "clout", "influence", and celebrity endorsements and advertising.

Instead, I'm happy to go on *other people's shows*. And now I will collect all my appearances and interviews here, in a big list.

|-|-|-|-|
|Dec 20, 2020|[Silent Night V3](https://twitter.com/mikeinspace/status/1340698646074015746?s=20)|1m,11s|Shorter, and with no mikeinspace, this time!|
|Dec 17, 2020|[A Bitcoin Christmas: Silent Night](https://youtu.be/737mPDwhaQM)|1m,47s|Me playing piano in mikeinspace's Twitter band.|
|Dec 16, 2020| [Bitcoin Stories Episode 048](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ3fqkPeQCc&feature=emb_logo)|1h,30m,35s|A really great talk where I answer the "Thiel Question" -- what's something you believe that most people don't agree with you on: many of the people you love will die because of the US stance toward betting. Thanks to Zack Hess for fixing up the audio.|
|Dec 14, 2020|[Bitcoin Reservations #004 - Smart wife asterisk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDIK2IBqCUk)|2h,33m,20s|Show is finally starting to get good.|
|Dec 7, 2020|[Bitcoin Reservations #003 - Twin sister hard fork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70vaR_dFJ0)|2h,33m,20s|Still the beginnings aren't great, but they are getting there.|
|Nov 30, 2020|[Bitcoin Reservations #002 - The prodigal son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0NaAyNFDA)|2h,16m,37s|The beginning isn't good at all but, it picks up steam quickly.|
|Nov 23, 2020|[Bitcoin Reservations #001 - Opposite of Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj4O6d48nlQ)|2h,19m,07s|A new podcast that (sort of) pays homage to Bitcoin Uncensored.|
|Nov 13, 2020|[CryptoVoices - Drivechain & Bitcoin Hivemind](https://soundcloud.com/cryptovoices/show-98-paul-sztorc-drivechain-bitcoin-hivemind-and-much-more)|3h,11m,49s|Good (and long) discussion of my two big interests/projects (sidechains and prediction markets), and my general approach to life.|
|Sep 17, 2020|[Me & Rafael LaVerde (VamosVigiliante), on Drivechain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbcIAaWScUc&feature=emb_logo)|1h,46m,11s|The third of three videos in my "week of BTC vs BCH/BSV debates". Rafael asked really good questions and is a great example of the kind of person I was hoping that drivechain and hivemind would appeal to. Lighter and more down to earth than the other two.|
|Sep 16, 2020|[BTC BCH BSV. Me vs Steve Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdDwwMKb2ow)|2h,13m,58s|Steve seems to be a real independent thinker, and a semi-outcast in BCH -- a similar position to me in BTC. I refuse to "cluster" my beliefs (ie, to ALWAYS believe the ALL the same things the other Maximalists), and Steve seems to act likewise. After we recorded this, we kept talking for like 3 more hours.|
|Sep 13, 2020|[Me (BTC) vs Daniel Krawisz (BSV), on Partyline](https://twitter.com/MDF_365/status/1305224590679896064?s=20)|1h,40m,47s|My duel with the infamous Emperor of Bitcoin. I was very worried that I would be crushed, and [prepared extensively](https://www.truthcoin.info/files/2020-09-13-krawisz-debate-prep.pdf). It seemed to pay off, because although he definitely controlled the very beginning, I got some good points in throughout.|
|Nov 8, 2019|[BTC vs BCH Debate - Me vs. Vin Armani, Hosted by Hotep Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkJt20f8tw4)|2h,36m,53s|To be honest with you, I was totally distracted during this conversation. It probably sounds silly to you, but my mind was blown that a reality TV star and marketer for 50 cent would be interested in my opinion on anything. Plus Vin was buttering me up the whole time before and during the show!|
|Mar 19, 2018|[Bitcoin Post-Maximalism and the Virtue of Motivated Ignorance with Paul Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCXY6ELBw0M)|2h,3m,12s|
