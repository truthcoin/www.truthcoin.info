title: All Paul Sztorc Bitcoin Media Appearances
---



I've enjoyed speaking on many podcasts hosted by other people, but personally I am not sure that I am cut out to be a podcast host:

* Attracting and keeping an audience is hard work, and takes a lot of time.
* I don't like the idea of doing a "regular" show -- ie, a show every week (or so). I'd rather only do a show if I have something important to say. Something worthy of people's scarce time and attention.
* As a podcast audience grows, the "audience capture" problem can arise, where a host gives people what they want to hear instead of speaking his mind. 

Instead, I'm happy to go on *other people's shows* (invite me on! -- I almost always say yes!). Here I collect my appearances and interviews in a big list.

I regret mentioning that, because I think this guy is so clueless that it never occured to him to look up any of the technical details whatsoever. I could have instead, just asked him 'what is bip300' and he would have gone down in flames immediately. Anyway, he was clearly unprepared making this mostly a waste of everyone's time.|

|Sep 17, 2020|[Me & Rafael LaVerde (VamosVigiliante), on Drivechain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbcIAaWScUc&feature=emb_logo)|1h,46m,11s|The third of three videos in my "week of BTC vs BCH/BSV debates". Rafael asked really good questions and is a great example of the kind of person I was hoping that drivechain and hivemind would appeal to. Lighter and more down to earth than the other two.|
|Sep 16, 2020|[BTC BCH BSV. Me vs Steve Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdDwwMKb2ow)|2h,13m,58s|Steve seems to be a real independent thinker, and a semi-outcast in BCH -- a similar position to me in BTC. I refuse to "cluster" my beliefs (ie, to ALWAYS believe the ALL the same things the other Maximalists), and Steve seems to act likewise. After we recorded this, we kept talking for like 3 more hours.|
|Sep 13, 2020|[Me (BTC) vs Daniel Krawisz (BSV), on Partyline](https://twitter.com/MDF_365/status/1305224590679896064?s=20)|1h,40m,47s|My duel with the infamous Emperor of Bitcoin. I was very worried that I would be crushed, and [prepared extensively](https://www.truthcoin.info/files/2020-09-13-krawisz-debate-prep.pdf). It seemed to pay off, because although he definitely controlled the very beginning, I got some good points in throughout.|

It is not worth watching because Dan was wrong about everything.|
|Mar 17, 2020|[Me on Shitcoin.tv again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QjqPQIjccw)|31m,34s|I REALLY enjoyed this talk. I think it is the type of content that you can't get anywhere else. Zcash as a sidechain, Handshake and decentralized naming, MimbleWimbleCoin shilling, Bitcoin maximalism once again|
|Feb 25, 2020|Marty Bent's [Tales from The Crypt #136](https://anchor.fm/tales-from-the-crypt/episodes/136-Paul-Sztorc-eb2i11)|2h,29m,22s|This podcast suffered from a long (and unexpected) digression into Proof of Stake at the very beginning (I guess that a lot of people would find it not interesting). Then it gets better -- fee market, Drivechain, and Prediction Markets.|

It probably sounds silly to you, but my mind was blown that a reality TV star and marketer for 50 cent would be interested in my opinion on anything. Plus Vin was buttering me up the whole time before and during the show!|

|Jun 25, 2019|[Bitcoin 2019 Krawisz Ambush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxv5zTX9GeQ)|5m,23s|This is one of my favorite things to ever happen -- Daniel Krawisz randomly ambushing people to grill them on BSV. I literally had no idea what he would ask and knew it would be adversarial "gotcha" journalism, but I just like DK so much I thought it would be fun to walk into the lion's den. Honestly I had a lot of fun people seemed to like my answers.|

### The "Prediction Market Revolution" Presentation

This presentation slowly takes shape over time. The "best" one (clearest and shortest) so far is Anarchapulco-2019.

I wrote an all-important "Part 2" to Anarchapulco-2019, but because of Covid there's been no venue to give it. I think it will be quite the talk, when people finally understand it. 

|Sep 8, 2019|[Chicago Bitcoin Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt2FMn5cNt0)|53m,32s|Elements of "part 2" are starting to take shape. Excellent group with good questions.|

|Jul 5, 2018|[Prediction Markets on Bitcoin - Amsterdam Bitcoin Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdqrzL2UnhA)|1h,29m,05s|Technically on Thursday as part of a two-day 5th anniverserary. Phil Zimmerman and Amir Taaki were there. Phil tried to trip me up with a question about rank-order voting. Still a bit rambly and confused, relative to the clearer/shorter anarchapulco. This one has a Q&A.|
|Feb 6, 2018|[TabConf 2018 - Bitcoin Hivemind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzaVt7uN4p4)|49m,00s|Longer than Anarchapulco and with But this one is longer and has a couple very interesting digressions. To my surprise, some people that I respect like this one more than Anarchapulco.|
